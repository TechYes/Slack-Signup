# Community Guidelines

The TechYes Community Guidelines states our ideals as a community.
It's meant to be a guide on how we work together and conduct ourselves, not
a specific rulebook. It is a way to communicate our existing values to the
entire community, and share our values with the â€˜verse.

## We strive to:

### Be considerate

Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the
work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and
we should consider them when making decisions.

### Be open and inviting

Our community has grown immensely because of the diversity that is found
within the community. We welcome all individuals regardless of, but not
limited to, their gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
preferred relationship model, disability, physical appearance, body size,
age, race, or religious affiliation. We take pride in the the richness of
experiences that have come to help develop the local tech community, and want to continue
growing our community. In short, __everyone__ is welcome, except those who
are unwelcoming.

### Be respectful

Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve
conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathetic
fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A
community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive
one. __Harassment of other community members is never&nbsp;okay__.


### Take responsibility for our words and our actions

We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If
someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully,
and work to right the wrong.

### Be collaborative

What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts; it is the sum of many
dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision
is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part
must make an effort to understand the whole.

Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work.
Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever
possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free
software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work
transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.

### Value decisiveness, clarity and open communication

Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to
persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.

We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements
constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to either
designated leaders at the event or within the community to arbitrate and
provide clarity and direction.

### Be responsive and helpful

All of us started as new and inexperienced. Even the most experienced of us
may forget things. Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community.
Questions are encouraged and those who are asked should endeavor to be
responsive, courteous, and helpful. When off topic, please direct to the
appropriate forum. Even when the question is common and repeatedly asked,
even when the documentation explains it, remember that they have only asked
it once and they may have read, but not understood. Ultimately, it is better
to give no answer than an unfriendly one.

### Step down considerately

When somebody leaves or disengages from the community, we ask that they do
so in a way that minimizes disruption to the projects using their published
work. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to
ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

### Adherence to these Community Guidelines

We ask that all in-person and virtual gatherings of the TechYes Community
adhere to this code of conduct and take appropriate steps to create a safe
and accessible space for all attendees. This should include the publication of a Code of
Conduct that includes clear anti-harassment procedures.

We understand and acknowledge that the "TechYes Community" is a loosely
defined group of people who identify as technology and design enthusiasts. We have no power
to actively remove someone from the community. Ultimately, we can only use
our voice to publicly declare that we do not agree with or endorse people
or organizations who don't act in the spirit of these guidelines.
